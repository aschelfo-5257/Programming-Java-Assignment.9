# Rational Table Method

| **Method** | **Purpose** | **Formula Used** |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| add | Add two rationals | (a/b) + (c/d) = (ad + bc) / bd |
| sub | Subtract two rationals | (a/b) - (c/d) = (ad - bc) / bd |
| mul | Multiply two rationals | (a/b) * (c/d) = (ac) / (bd) |
| div | Divide two rationals | (a/b) / (c/d) = (ad) / (bc) |
| checkEqual | Check if two rationals are equal | Compare (ad) and (cb) |
| show | 	Print the rational as "num/denum" | - |
